Here I have created a survey with a couple of smiley faces where you can sumbit the feedback with click of a button. Once the feedback has been submitted a thank you message appears.

I made use of CSS HTML and Javascript - make use of event bubbling and event nodes and dealing with the DOM.

CSS used to create the interface.
